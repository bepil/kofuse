kofuse.help=Find a function by type signature. Example usage: 'apackage.InputType0,anotherpackage.InputType1:somepackage.ReturnType' finds all functions that return a type 'ReturnType', where the function requires no input types besides 'InputType0' and 'InputType1'. Functions that don't require any inputs or only require either 'InputType0' or 'InputType1' are also found. Inputs for a function are the function parameters, as well as the receiver type if the function is a method.\n\n Types need to be entered completely by fully qualified name: the full package name needs to be included.
